  name: normalize-before-validate
  summary: >
    Insert a normalizeYaml() layer between raw parse (yaml.load) and schema
    validation (Zod.parse) to handle format variants across projects.
    The schema stays strict; normalization handles array→record conversion,
    status value mapping, field renaming, and null→undefined stripping.

  name: clientonly-usebsyncExternalStore
  summary: >
    Use useSyncExternalStore with a noop subscribe and getServerSnapshot
    returning true to create a zero-render ClientOnly wrapper. Unlike
    useState+useEffect, this avoids triggering a second render after
    hydration — the component simply never renders during SSR.
